    "summary": "Strong coupling between light and matter is the foundation of promising quantum photonic devices such as deterministic single photon sources, single atom lasers and photonic quantum gates, which consist of an atom and a photonic cavity. Unlike atom-based systems, a strong coupling unit based on an emitter-plasmonic nanocavity system has the potential to bring these devices to the microchip scale at ambient conditions. However, efficiently and precisely positioning a single or a few emitters into a plasmonic nanocavity is challenging. In addition, placing a strong coupling unit on a designated substrate location is a demanding task. Here, fluorophore-modified DNA strands are utilized to drive the formation of particle-on-film plasmonic nanocavities and simultaneously integrate the fluorophores into the high field region of the nanocavities. High cavity yield and fluorophore coupling yield are demonstrated. This method is then combined with e-beam lithography to position the strong coupling units on designated locations of a substrate. Furthermore, the high correlation between electronic transition of the fluorophore and the cavity resonance is observed, implying more vibrational modes may be involved. Our system makes strong coupling units more practical on the microchip scale and at ambient conditions and provides a stable platform for investigating fluorophore-plasmonic nanocavity interaction.",

    "summary": "Humans are very skillful in communicating their intent for when and where a handover would occur. On the other hand, even the state-of-the-art robotic implementations for handovers display a general lack of communication skills. We propose visualizing the internal state and intent of robots for Human-to-Robot Handovers using Augmented Reality. Specifically, we visualize 3D models of the object and the robotic gripper to communicate the robot's estimation of where the object is and the pose that the robot intends to grasp the object. We conduct a user study with 16 participants, in which each participant handed over a cube-shaped object to the robot 12 times. Results show that visualizing robot intent using augmented reality substantially improves the subjective experience of the users for handovers and decreases the time to transfer the object. Results also indicate that the benefits of augmented reality are still present even when the robot makes errors in localizing the object.",

    "categories": "stat.ME",
    "summary": "Over the past ten years, propensity score methods have made an important contribution to improving generalizations from studies that do not select samples randomly from a population of inference. However, these methods require assumptions and recent work has considered the role of bounding approaches that provide a range of treatment impact estimates that are consistent with the observable data. An important limitation to bound estimates is that they can be uninformatively wide. This has motivated research on the use of propensity score stratification to narrow bounds. This article assesses the role of distributional overlap in propensity scores on the effectiveness of stratification to tighten bounds. Using the results of two simulation studies and two case studies, I evaluate the relationship between distributional overlap and precision gain and discuss the implications when propensity score stratification is used as a method to improve precision in the bounding framework.",

    "summary": "We demonstrated on Ag(111) and Ag(100) surfaces that the reciprocal of the field emission resonance (FER) linewidth, which is proportional to the mean lifetime of resonant electrons in FER, may vary with the electric field. The variation on Ag(111) was nearly smooth, whereas that on Ag(100) was sporadic and fluctuated remarkably. This drastic difference can be explained through their dissimilar projected bulk band structures and the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics, according to which all resonant electrons are governed by a single wave function. Ag(100) has an energy gap above its vacuum level, whereas Ag(111) does not. Consequently, the dissipation rate of the wave function, which is relevant to the FER linewidth, on Ag(111) was almost stable, whereas that on Ag(100) fluctuated. The fluctuation revealed that the quantum trapping effect and surface dipole layer on Ag(100) surface can be investigated through FER.",

    "summary": "Background and Objective: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it has high mortality rate with patients commonly present with the disease at stage 3 and above. There are only relatively few methods that simultaneously detect and classify nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. Furthermore, very few studies have used semi-supervised learning for lung cancer prediction. This study presents a complete end-to-end scheme to detect and classify lung nodules using the state-of-the-art Self-training with Noisy Student method on a comprehensive CT lung screening dataset of around 4,000 CT scans. Methods: We used three datasets, namely LUNA16, LIDC and NLST, for this study. We first utilise a three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network model to detect lung nodules in the detection stage. The classification model known as Maxout Local-Global Network uses non-local networks to detect global features including shape features, residual blocks to detect local features including nodule texture, and a Maxout layer to detect nodule variations. We trained the first Self-training with Noisy Student model to predict lung cancer on the unlabelled NLST datasets. Then, we performed Mixup regularization to enhance our scheme and provide robustness to erroneous labels. Results and Conclusions: Our new Mixup Maxout Local-Global network achieves an AUC of 0.87 on 2,005 completely independent testing scans from the NLST dataset. Our new scheme significantly outperformed the next highest performing method at the 5% significance level using DeLong's test (p = 0.0001). This study presents a new complete end-to-end scheme to predict lung cancer using Self-training with Noisy Student combined with Mixup regularization. On a completely independent dataset of 2,005 scans, we achieved state-of-the-art performance even with more images as compared to other methods.",

    "categories": "physics.flu-dyn cs.CE physics.ao-ph physics.comp-ph",
    "summary": "Knowledge of bubble and drop size distributions in two-phase flows is important for characterizing a wide range of phenomena, including combustor ignition, sonar communication, and cloud formation. The physical mechanisms driving the background flow also drive the time evolution of these distributions. Accurate and robust identification and tracking algorithms for the dispersed phase are necessary to reliably measure this evolution and thereby quantify the underlying mechanisms in interface-resolving flow simulations. The identification of individual bubbles and drops traditionally relies on an algorithm used to identify connected regions. This traditional algorithm can be sensitive to the presence of spurious structures. A cost-effective refinement is proposed to maximize volume accuracy while minimizing the identification of spurious bubbles and drops. An accurate identification scheme is crucial for distinguishing bubble and drop pairs with large size ratios. The identified bubbles and drops need to be tracked in time to obtain breakup and coalescence statistics that characterize the evolution of the size distribution, including breakup and coalescence frequencies, and the probability distributions of parent and child bubble and drop sizes. An algorithm based on mass conservation is proposed to construct bubble and drop lineages using simulation snapshots that are not necessarily from consecutive time-steps. These lineages are then used to detect breakup and coalescence events, and obtain the desired statistics. Accurate identification of large-size-ratio bubble and drop pairs enables accurate detection of breakup and coalescence events over a large size range. Together, these algorithms enable insights into the mechanisms behind bubble and drop formation and evolution in flows of practical importance.",

MGLM marginalizes over all possible factorizations within and across all channels. MGLM endows flexible inference, including unconditional generation, conditional generation (where 1 channel is observed and other channels are generated), and partially observed generation (where incomplete observations are spread across all the channels). We experiment with the Multi30K dataset containing English, French, Czech, and German. We demonstrate experiments with unconditional, conditional, and partially conditional generation.

    "summary": "In a neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) experiment, energy resolution is important to distinguish between $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and background events. CAlcium fluoride for studies of Neutrino and Dark matters by Low Energy Spectrometer (CANDLES) discerns the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ of $^{48}$Ca using a CaF$_2$ scintillator as the detector and source. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) collect scintillation photons. At the Q-value of $^{48}$Ca, the current energy resolution (2.6%) exceeds the ideal statistical fluctuation of the number of photoelectrons (1.6%). Because of CaF$_2$'s long decay constant of 1000 ns, a signal integration within 4000 ns is used to calculate the energy. The baseline fluctuation ($\\sigma_{baseline}$) is accumulated in the signal integration, thus degrading the energy resolution. This paper studies $\\sigma_{baseline}$ in the CANDLES detector, which severely degrades the resolution by 1% at the Q-value of $^{48}$Ca. To avoid $\\sigma_{\\rm baseline}$, photon counting can be used to obtain the number of photoelectrons in each PMT; however, a significant photoelectron signal overlapping probability in each PMT causes missing photoelectrons in counting and reduces the energy resolution. \"Partial photon counting\" reduces $\\sigma_{baseline}$ and minimizes photoelectron loss. We obtain improved energy resolutions of 4.5-4.0% at 1460.8 keV ($\\gamma$-ray of $^{40}$K), and 3.3-2.9% at 2614.5 keV ($\\gamma$-ray of $^{208}$Tl). The energy resolution at the Q-value is estimated to be improved from 2.6% to 2.2%, and the detector sensitivity for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ half-life of $^{48}$Ca can be improved by 1.09 times.",

    "summary": "The chest X-ray plays a key role in screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases including the COVID-19. More recently, many works construct deep neural networks (DNNs) for chest X-ray images to realize automated and efficient diagnosis of lung diseases. However, bias field caused by the improper medical image acquisition process widely exists in the chest X-ray images while the robustness of DNNs to the bias field is rarely explored, which definitely poses a threat to the X-ray-based automated diagnosis system. In this paper, we study this problem based on the recent adversarial attack and propose a brand new attack, i.e., the adversarial bias field attack where the bias field instead of the additive noise works as the adversarial perturbations for fooling the DNNs. This novel attack posts a key problem: how to locally tune the bias field to realize high attack success rate while maintaining its spatial smoothness to guarantee high realisticity. These two goals contradict each other and thus has made the attack significantly challenging. To overcome this challenge, we propose the adversarial-smooth bias field attack that can locally tune the bias field with joint smooth & adversarial constraints. As a result, the adversarial X-ray images can not only fool the DNNs effectively but also retain very high level of realisticity. We validate our method on real chest X-ray datasets with powerful DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, DenseNet121, and MobileNet, and show different properties to the state-of-the-art attacks in both image realisticity and attack transferability. Our method reveals the potential threat to the DNN-based X-ray automated diagnosis and can definitely benefit the development of bias-field-robust automated diagnosis system.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04804v1",
    "categories": "physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph",
    "summary": "Breaking waves generate a distribution of bubble sizes that evolves over time. Knowledge of how this distribution evolves is of practical importance for maritime and climate studies. The analytical framework developed in Part 1 examined how this evolution is governed by the bubble-mass flux from large to small bubble sizes, which depends on the rate of break-up events and the distribution of child bubble sizes. These statistics are measured in Part 2 as ensemble-averaged functions of time by simulating ensembles of breaking waves, and identifying and tracking individual bubbles and their break-up events. The break-up dynamics are seen to be statistically unsteady, and two intervals with distinct characteristics were identified. In the first interval, the dissipation rate and bubble-mass flux are quasi-steady, and the theoretical analysis of Part 1 is supported by all observed statistics, including the expected -10/3 power-law exponent for the super-Hinze-scale size distribution. Strong locality is observed in the corresponding bubble-mass flux, supporting the presence of a super-Hinze-scale break-up cascade. In the second interval, the dissipation rate decays, and the bubble-mass flux increases as small- and intermediate-sized bubbles become more populous. This flux remains strongly local with cascade-like behaviour, but the dominant power-law exponent for the size distribution increases to -8/3 as small bubbles are also depleted more quickly. This suggests the emergence of different physical mechanisms during different phases of the breaking-wave evolution, although size-local break-up remains a dominant theme. Parts 1 and 2 present an analytical toolkit for population balance analysis in two-phase flows.",

The model is built on prior work on score matching and diffusion probabilistic models. It starts from a Gaussian white noise signal and iteratively refines the signal via a gradient-based sampler conditioned on the mel-spectrogram. WaveGrad offers a natural way to trade inference speed for sample quality by adjusting the number of refinement steps, and bridges the gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models in terms of audio quality. We find that it can generate high fidelity audio samples using as few as six iterations. Experiments reveal WaveGrad to generate high fidelity audio, outperforming adversarial non-autoregressive baselines and matching a strong likelihood-based autoregressive baseline using fewer sequential operations.

    "categories": "physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph",
    "summary": "Breaking waves entrain gas beneath the surface. The wave-breaking process energizes turbulent fluctuations that break bubbles in quick succession to generate a wide range of bubble sizes. Understanding this generation mechanism paves the way towards the development of predictive models for large-scale maritime and climate simulations. Garrett et al. (2000) suggested that super-Hinze-scale turbulent breakup transfers entrained gas from large to small bubble sizes in the manner of a cascade. We provide a theoretical basis for this bubble-mass cascade by appealing to how energy is transferred from large to small scales in the energy cascade central to single-phase turbulence theories. A bubble break-up cascade requires that break-up events predominantly transfer bubble mass from a certain bubble size to a slightly smaller size on average. This property is called locality. In this paper, we analytically quantify locality by extending the population balance equation in conservative form to derive the bubble-mass transfer rate from large to small sizes. Using our proposed measures of locality, we show that scalings relevant to turbulent bubbly flows, including those postulated by Garrett et al. (2000) and observed in breaking-wave experiments and simulations, are consistent with a strongly local transfer rate, where the influence of non-local contributions decays in a power-law fashion. These theoretical predictions are confirmed using numerical simulations in Part 2, revealing key physical aspects of the bubble break-up cascade phenomenology. Locality supports the universality of turbulent small-bubble break-up, which simplifies the development of subgrid-scale models to predict oceanic small-bubble statistics of practical importance.",

External backgrounds were rejected using a 4$\\pi$ active shield of a liquid scintillator surrounding the CaF$_2$ crystals.

We analyzed the data obtained in the Kamioka underground for a live-time of 130.4\\,days to evaluate the feasibility of the low background measurement with the CANDLES-III detector. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated the background rate from the radioactive impurities in the CaF$_{2}$ crystals and the rate of high energy $\\gamma$-rays caused by the (n, $\\gamma$) reactions induced by environmental neutrons. The expected background rate was in a good agreement with the measured rate, i.e., approximately 10$^{-3}$ events/keV/yr/(kg of $^{\\rm nat.}$Ca), in the 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ window. In conclusion, the background candidates were estimated properly by comparing the measured energy spectrum with the background simulations.

    "summary": "Atomicity is a correctness criterion to reason about isolated code regions in a multithreaded program when they are executed concurrently. However, dynamic instances of these code regions, called transactions, may fail to behave atomically, resulting in transactional atomicity violations. Existing dynamic online atomicity checkers incur either false positives or false negatives in detecting transactions experiencing transactional atomicity violations. This paper proposes RegionTrack. RegionTrack tracks cross-thread dependences at the event, dynamic subregion, and transaction levels. It maintains both dynamic subregions within selected transactions and transactional happens-before relations through its novel timestamp propagation approach. We prove that RegionTrack is sound and complete in detecting both transactional atomicity violations and non-serializable traces. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first online technique that precisely captures the transitively closed set of happens-before relations over all conflicting events with respect to every running transaction for the above two kinds of issues. We have evaluated RegionTrack on 19 subjects of the DaCapo and the Java Grande Forum benchmarks. The empirical results confirm that RegionTrack precisely detected all those transactions which experienced transactional atomicity violations and identified all non-serializable traces. The overall results also show that RegionTrack incurred 1.10x and 1.08x lower memory and runtime overheads than Velodrome and 2.10x and 1.21x lower than Aerodrome, respectively. Moreover, it incurred 2.89x lower memory overhead than DoubleChecker. On average, Velodrome detected about 55% fewer violations than RegionTrack, which in turn reported about 3%-70% fewer violations than DoubleChecker.",

    "summary": "This article surveys the literature on human-robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative joint action where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: 1) a pre-handover phase, and 2) the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, grip release) of the handover, we briefly discuss also the concepts of safety, social context, and ergonomics. We compare the behaviours displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants, and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to enable a fair comparison among the approaches.",

We apply the balanced HKZ-reduction theory to study the growth of the {\\em $g$-invariants} of the ring of integers of $K$. More precisely, for each positive integer $n$, let $\\mathcal O$ be the ring of integers of $K$ and $g_{\\mathcal O}(n)$ be the smallest integer such that every sum of squares of $n$-ary $\\mathcal O$-linear forms must be a sum of $g_{\\mathcal O}(n)$ squares of $n$-ary $\\mathcal O$-linear forms. We show that when $K$ has class number 1, the growth of $g_{\\mathcal O}(n)$ is at most an exponential of $\\sqrt{n}$. This extends the recent result obtained by Beli-Chan-Icaza-Liu on the growth of $g_{\\mathbb Z}(n)$ and gives the first sub-exponential upper bound for $g_{\\mathcal O}(n)$ for rings of integers $\\mathcal O$ other than $\\mathbb Z$.",

    "summary": "The increasing presence of robots alongside humans, such as in human-robot teams in manufacturing, gives rise to research questions about the kind of behaviors people prefer in their robot counterparts. We term actions that support interaction by reducing future interference with others as supportive robot actions and investigate their utility in a co-located manipulation scenario. We compare two robot modes in a shared table pick-and-place task: (1) Task-oriented: the robot only takes actions to further its own task objective and (2) Supportive: the robot sometimes prefers supportive actions to task-oriented ones when they reduce future goal-conflicts. Our experiments in simulation, using a simplified human model, reveal that supportive actions reduce the interference between agents, especially in more difficult tasks, but also cause the robot to take longer to complete the task. We implemented these modes on a physical robot in a user study where a human and a robot perform object placement on a shared table. Our results show that a supportive robot was perceived as a more favorable coworker by the human and also reduced interference with the human in the more difficult of two scenarios. However, it also took longer to complete the task highlighting an interesting trade-off between task-efficiency and human-preference that needs to be considered before designing robot behavior for close-proximity manipulation scenarios.",

In addition, we adapt the Imputer model for non-autoregressive machine translation and demonstrate that Imputer with just 4 generation steps can match the performance of an autoregressive Transformer baseline. Our latent alignment models are simpler than many existing non-autoregressive translation baselines; for example, we do not require target length prediction or re-scoring with an autoregressive model. On the competitive WMT'14 En$\\rightarrow$De task, our CTC model achieves 25.7 BLEU with a single generation step, while Imputer achieves 27.5 BLEU with 2 generation steps, and 28.0 BLEU with 4 generation steps.

    "summary": "When introducing new strategies to the existing one, two key issues should be addressed. One is to efficiently distribute computational resources so that the appropriate strategy dominates. The other is to remedy or even eliminate the drawback of inappropriate strategies. Adaptation is a popular and efficient method for strategy adjustments and has been widely studied in the literature. Existing methods commonly involve the trials of multiple strategies and then reward better-performing one with more resources based on their previous performance. As a result, it may not efficiently address those two key issues. On the one hand, they are based on trial-and-error with inappropriate strategies consuming resources. On the other hand, since multiple strategies are involved in the trial, the inappropriate strategies could mislead the search. In this paper, we propose an adaptive differential evolution (DE) with explicit exploitation and exploration controls (Explicit adaptation DE, EaDE), which is the first attempt using offline knowledge to separate multiple strategies to exempt the optimization from trial-and-error. EaDE divides the evolution process into several SCSS (Selective-candidate with similarity selection) generations and adaptive generations. Exploitation and exploration needs are learned in the SCSS generations by a relatively balanced strategy. While in the adaptive generations, to meet these needs, two other alternative strategies, an exploitative one or an explorative one is employed. Experimental studies on 28 benchmark functions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Building on recent advances in insertion-based modeling, we first introduce a soft order-reward framework that enables us to train models to follow arbitrary oracle generation policies. We then make use of this framework to explore a large variety of generation orders, including uninformed orders, location-based orders, frequency-based orders, content-based orders, and model-based orders. Curiously, we find that for the WMT'14 English $\\to$ German translation task, order does not have a substantial impact on output quality, with unintuitive orderings such as alphabetical and shortest-first matching the performance of a standard Transformer. This demonstrates that traditional left-to-right generation is not strictly necessary to achieve high performance. On the other hand, results on the WMT'18 English $\\to$ Chinese task tend to vary more widely, suggesting that translation for less well-aligned language pairs may be more sensitive to generation order.",

We complement the acoustic features in a hybrid DNN-HMM model with information of the target speaker's identity as well as visual features from the mouth region of the target speaker. Experimentation was performed using simulated cocktail-party data generated from the GRID audio-visual corpus by overlapping two speakers's speech on a single acoustic channel. Our audio-only baseline achieved a WER of 26.3%. The audio-visual model improved the WER to 4.4%. Introducing speaker identity information had an even more pronounced effect, improving the WER to 3.6%. Combining both approaches, however, did not significantly improve performance further.

KERMIT models the joint distribution and its decompositions (i.e., marginals and conditionals) using a single neural network and, unlike much prior work, does not rely on a prespecified factorization of the data distribution. During training, one can feed KERMIT paired data $(x, y)$ to learn the joint distribution $p(x, y)$, and optionally mix in unpaired data $x$ or $y$ to refine the marginals $p(x)$ or $p(y)$. During inference, we have access to the conditionals $p(x \\mid y)$ and $p(y \\mid x)$ in both directions. We can also sample from the joint distribution or the marginals. The model supports both serial fully autoregressive decoding and parallel partially autoregressive decoding, with the latter exhibiting an empirically logarithmic runtime. We demonstrate through experiments in machine translation, representation learning, and zero-shot cloze question answering that our unified approach is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of dedicated state-of-the-art systems across a wide range of tasks without the need for problem-specific architectural adaptation.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the malignancy of nodules that have the capability to analyze the shape and size of a nodule using a global feature extractor, as well as the density and structure of the nodule using a local feature extractor. Methods: We propose to use Residual Blocks with a 3x3 kernel size for local feature extraction, and Non-Local Blocks to extract the global features. The Non-Local Block has the ability to extract global features without using a huge number of parameters. The key idea behind the Non-Local Block is to apply matrix multiplications between features on the same feature maps. Results: We trained and validated the proposed method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset which contains 1,018 computed tomography (CT) scans. We followed a rigorous procedure for experimental setup namely, 10-fold cross-validation and ignored the nodules that had been annotated by less than 3 radiologists. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results with AUC=95.62%, while significantly outperforming other baseline methods. Conclusions: Our proposed Deep Local-Global network has the capability to accurately extract both local and global features.

    "summary": "We demonstrate that the linewidth of the field emission resonance (FER) observed on the surface of MoS2 using scanning tunneling microscopy can vary by up to one order of magnitude with an increase in the electric field. This unusual phenomenon originates from quantum trapping, where the electron relaxed from the resonant electron in the FER is momentarily trapped in the potential well on the MoS2 surface. Because the relaxed electron and the resonant electron have the same spin and the action of the Pauli exclusion principle, the lifetimes of the resonant electrons can be substantially prolonged when the relaxed electrons engage in the resonance trapping. The linewidth of the FER is thus shrunk considerably to as narrow as 12 meV. Moreover, it was found that the valley intensities around the FER are zero, indicating that MoS2 has an energy gap above the vacuum level. By using the energies of FERs, the potential of the band bending in the MoS2 interior can be measured precisely.",

    "summary": "We present the Insertion Transformer, an iterative, partially autoregressive model for sequence generation based on insertion operations. Unlike typical autoregressive models which rely on a fixed, often left-to-right ordering of the output, our approach accommodates arbitrary orderings by allowing for tokens to be inserted anywhere in the sequence during decoding. This flexibility confers a number of advantages: for instance, not only can our model be trained to follow specific orderings such as left-to-right generation or a binary tree traversal, but it can also be trained to maximize entropy over all valid insertions for robustness. In addition, our model seamlessly accommodates both fully autoregressive generation (one insertion at a time) and partially autoregressive generation (simultaneous insertions at multiple locations). We validate our approach by analyzing its performance on the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task under various settings for training and decoding. We find that the Insertion Transformer outperforms many prior non-autoregressive approaches to translation at comparable or better levels of parallelism, and successfully recovers the performance of the original Transformer while requiring only logarithmically many iterations during decoding.",

We propose an approach to protect user's data during the inference phase, while still achieve good classification accuracy. We conduct an experimental evaluation of this approach on benchmark datasets of three computer vision tasks. The experimental results indicate that this approach can be used to significantly attenuate the capacity for an adversary with access to the state-of-the-art deep network's intermediate states to learn privacy-sensitive inputs to the network. For example, we demonstrate that our approach can prevent attackers from inferring the private attributes such as gender from the Face image dataset without sacrificing the classification accuracy of the original machine learning task such as Face Identification.",

    "categories": "physics.flu-dyn",
    "summary": "Micro-bubbles are of significant interest due to the long-living signature they leave behind naval ships. In order to numerically model and predict these bubbles in naval applications, subgrid-scale models are required because of the extreme separation of length- and time-scales between the macroscopic geometries and the physical processes leading to the formation of these bubbles. Yet, there is much that is unknown about the mechanism behind the entrainment of such bubbles. Furthermore, quantitative information regarding their size distribution and dependence on flow parameters is very limited. Impact events are hypothesized to be the main contributor to the generation of micro-bubbles. This is due to a phenomenon known as Mesler entrainment, which has been observed in the context of the drop-pool impact problem. Namely, when a water droplet with diameter of $\\mathcal{O}(1mm)$ impacts a deep water pool with an impact velocity of $\\mathcal{O}(1m/s)$, hundreds of air micro-bubbles are entrained into the pool. These bubbles have been found to be remnants of a very thin air film entrapped between the two liquid bodies. These films have extremely high aspect ratios and after being punctured, shed micro-bubbles while retracting on time scales much shorter than the outer flow time scales. This separation of time-scales, along with a lacking of studies on retracting thin gas films has motivated us to study this fundamental problem with numerical simulations in two and three dimensions. Using a diffuse interface method, we perform two-phase simulations of retracting thin gas films in initially static liquid backgrounds to gain understanding regarding this problem and gather statistics that can be potentially used in a subgrid-scale model to predict micro-bubble shedding from a thin gas film. Coupling a model like this to a model that predicts the thin film characteristics ...",

    "summary": "The generation of microbubbles upon the collision and interaction of liquid bodies in a gaseous environment is a ubiquitous process in two-phase flows, including large-scale phenomena like ship wakes, breaking waves and rain showers. These collision and interaction events involve the relative approach of pairs of liquid-gas interfaces. As these interfaces approach, the smallest length scales of the system are dynamically reduced. This evolving disparity in length scales is numerically challenging to resolve without the employment of subgrid-scale (SGS) impact and breakup models. In this study, a physics-based impact and breakup model for the generation of these microbubbles is developed and implemented. The objectives of this study are to develop a computational algorithm that identifies interface collision events that contribute to the formation of microbubbles, to formulate a physics-based breakup model that predicts the distribution of microbubble sizes using the characteristics of the originating gas film, and to integrate these modules into a two-phase flow solver that accurately captures the effects of bubbles of all sizes. In these proceedings, an SGS model suitable for the aforementioned problems is proposed, and the steps involved in implementing the proposed SGS model in a macroscale flow solver are outlined. Two aspects of the development of this SGS model are then discussed in detail. First, the formulation and implementation of the first step of the SGS model, the collision detection algorithm, is detailed. Second, preliminary findings of a numerical investigation intended to shed light on breakup processes in turbulent two-phase flows are presented.",

In this work, we model text via a sequence of Unicode bytes, specifically, the UTF-8 variable length byte sequence for each character. Bytes allow us to avoid large softmaxes in languages with large vocabularies, and share representations in multilingual models. We show that bytes are superior to grapheme characters over a wide variety of languages in monolingual end-to-end speech recognition. Additionally, our multilingual byte model outperform each respective single language baseline on average by 4.4% relatively. In Japanese-English code-switching speech, our multilingual byte model outperform our monolingual baseline by 38.6% relatively. Finally, we present an end-to-end multilingual speech synthesis model using byte representations which matches the performance of our monolingual baselines.",

    "summary": "Differential Evolution (DE) is recognized as one of the most powerful optimizers in the evolutionary algorithm (EA) family. Many DE variants were proposed in recent years, but significant differences in performances between them are hardly observed. Therefore, this paper suggests a multi-layer competitive-cooperative (MLCC) framework to facilitate the competition and cooperation of multiple DEs, which in turns, achieve a significant performance improvement. Unlike other multi-method strategies which adopt a multi-population based structure, with individuals only evolving in their corresponding subpopulations, MLCC implements a parallel structure with the entire population simultaneously monitored by multiple DEs assigned to their corresponding layers. An individual can store, utilize and update its evolution information in different layers based on an individual preference based layer selecting (IPLS) mechanism and a computational resource allocation bias (RAB) mechanism. In IPLS, individuals connect to only one favorite layer. While in RAB, high-quality solutions are evolved by considering all the layers. Thus DEs associated in the layers work in a competitive and cooperative manner. The proposed MLCC framework has been implemented on several highly competitive DEs. Experimental studies show that the MLCC variants significantly outperform the baseline DEs as well as several state-of-the-art and up-to-date DEs on CEC benchmark functions.",

However, these methods typically rely on assumptions whose plausibility may be questionable in practice. In this article, we introduce and discuss bounding, an approach that is based on alternative assumptions that may be more plausible in a given study. The bounding framework nonparametrically estimates population parameters using a range of plausible values that are consistent with the observed characteristics of the data. We illustrate how the bounds can be tightened using three approaches: imposing an alternative assumption based on monotonicity, redefining the population of inference, and using propensity score stratification. Using the results from two simulation studies, we examine the conditions under which bounds for the population parameter are tightened. We conclude with an application of bounding to SimCalc, a cluster randomized trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a technology aid on mathematics achievement.",

    "categories": "cs.NE",
    "summary": "Achieving better exploitation and exploration capabilities (EEC) have always been an important yet challenging issue in the design of evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA). The difficulties lie in obtaining a good balance in EEC, which is determined cooperatively by operations and parameters in an EOA. When deficiencies in exploitation or exploration are observed, most existing works consider a piecemeal approach, either by designing new operations or by altering the parameters. Unfortunately, when different situations are encountered, these proposals may fail to be the winner. To address these problems, this paper proposes an explicit EEC control method named selective-candidate framework with similarity selection rule (SCSS). M (M > 1) candidates are first generated from each current solution with independent operations and parameters to enrich the search. Then, a similarity selection rule is designed to determine the final candidate by considering the fitness ranking of the current solution and its Euclidian distance to each of these M candidates. Superior current solutions will prefer the closest candidates for efficient local exploitation while inferior ones will favor the farthest for exploration purpose. In this way, the rule could synthesize exploitation and exploration, making the evolution more effective. When applied to three classic, four state-of-the-art and four up-to-date EOAs from branches of differential evolution, evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, significant enhancement in performance is achieved.",

The slip boundary condition at a fluid-solid interface has hitherto been considered separately for gases and liquids. In this paper, we show that the slip velocity in both gases and liquids may originate from dynamical adsorption processes at the interface. A unified analytical model that is valid for both gas-solid and liquid-solid slip boundary conditions is proposed based on surface science theory. The corroboration with experimental data extracted from the literature shows that the proposed model provides an improved prediction compared to existing analytical models for gases at higher shear rates and close agreement for liquid-solid interfaces in general.",

Here we demonstrate a light-dragging experiment in an electromagnetically induced transparent cold atomic ensemble and enhance the dragging effect by at least three orders of magnitude compared with the previous experiments. With a large enhancement of the dragging effect, we realize an atom-based velocimeter that has a sensitivity two orders of magnitude higher than the velocity width of the atomic medium used.

    "summary": "Recent methods to improve generalizations from nonrandom samples typically invoke assumptions such as the strong ignorability of sample selection that are often controversial in practice to derive point estimates. Rather than focus on the point estimate based inferences, this article considers inferences on partially identified estimates from fewer and weaker assumptions. We extend partial identification methods to causal generalization with nonrandom samples by using a cluster randomized trial in education. Bounds on the population average treatment effect are derived under four cases, two under no assumptions on the data, and two that assume bounded sample variation and monotonicity of response. This approach is amenable to incorporating population data frames to tighten bounds on the population average treatment effect. Under the assumptions of bounded sample variation and monotonicity, the interval estimates of the average treatment effect provide sufficiently informative bounds to rule out large treatment effects, which are consistent with the point estimates from the experimental study. This illustrates that partial identification methods can provide an alternative perspective to causal generalization in the absence of strong ignorability of sample selection.",

    "summary": "Random linear network coding (RLNC) in theory achieves the max-flow capacity of multicast networks, at the cost of high decoding complexity. To improve the performance-complexity tradeoff, we consider the design of sparse network codes. A generation-based strategy is employed in which source packets are grouped into overlapping subsets called generations. RLNC is performed only amongst packets belonging to the same generation throughout the network so that sparseness can be maintained. In this paper, generation-based network codes with low reception overheads and decoding costs are designed for transmitting of the order of $10^2$-$10^3$ source packets. A low-complexity overhead-optimized decoder is proposed that exploits \"overlaps\" between generations. The sparseness of the codes is exploited through local processing and multiple rounds of pivoting of the decoding matrix. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, codes comprising a binary precode, random overlapping generations, and binary RLNC are designed. The results show that our designs can achieve negligible code overheads at low decoding costs, and outperform existing network codes that use the generation based strategy.",

We consider both radiative (mediated by real photons) and non-radiative (mediated by virtual photons) mechanisms of energy transfer using a unified Green's function approach that takes into account modification of the exciton energy dispersions as a result of interactions. The large optical oscillator strengths associated with excitons in TMDs result in very fast energy transfer rates. The energy transfer times depend on the exciton momentum, exciton linewidth, and the interlayer separation and can range from values less than 100 femtoseconds to more than tens of picoseconds. Whereas inside the light cone the energy transfer rates of longitudinal and transverse excitons are comparable, outside the light cone the energy transfer rates of longitudinal excitons far exceed those of transverse excitons. Average energy transfer times for a thermal ensemble of longitudinal and transverse excitons is temperature dependent and can be smaller than a picosecond at room temperature for interlayer separations smaller than 10 nm. Energy transfer times of localized excitons range from values less than a picosecond to several tens of picoseconds. When the exciton scattering and dephasing rates are small, energy transfer dynamics exhibit coherent oscillations. Our results show that electromagnetic interlayer energy transfer can be an efficient mechanism for energy exchange between TMD monolayers.",

The allocation dynamically assigns multicast clients to the quality layers of a scalable video bitstream, based on their heterogeneous channel qualities and video playback capabilities. Normalized mean opinion score (NMOS) is employed to value the client's quality of experience across various possible adaptations of a multilayer video, coded using mixed spatial-temporal-amplitude scalability. The scheme provides assurance of reception of the video layers using fountain coding and effectively allocates coding rates across the layers to maximize a multicast utility measure. An advantageous feature of the proposed scheme is that the complexity of the optimization is independent of the number of clients. Additionally, a convex formulation is proposed that attains close to the best performance and offers a reliable alternative when further reduction in computational complexity is desired. The optimization is extended to perform suppression of QoE fluctuations for clients with marginal channel qualities. The scheme offers a means to trade-off service utility for the entire multicast group and clients with the worst channels. According to the simulation results, the proposed optimization framework is robust against source rate variations and limited amount of client feedback.",

    "summary": "An Android-based smart Television (TV) must reliably run its applications in an embedded program environment under diverse hardware resource conditions. Owing to the diverse hardware components used to build numerous TV models, TV simulators are usually not high enough in fidelity to simulate various TV models, and thus are only regarded as unreliable alternatives when stress testing such applications. Therefore, even though stress testing on real TV sets is tedious, it is the de facto approach to ensure the reliability of these applications in the industry. In this paper, we study to what extent stress testing of smart TV applications can be fully automated in the industrial environments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has addressed this important question. We summarize the find-ings collected from 10 industrial test engineers to have tested 20 such TV applications in a real production environment. Our study shows that the industry required test automation supports on high-level GUI object controls and status checking, setup of resource conditions and the interplay between the two. With such supports, 87% of the industrial test specifications of one TV model can be fully automated and 71.4% of them were found to be fully reusable to test a subsequent TV model with major up-grades of hardware, operating system and application. It repre-sents a significant improvement with margins of 28% and 38%, respectively, compared to stress testing without such supports.",

Here, we present a probabilistic framework for diffusion in networks and propose to classify agent interactions according to two protocols where the total network quantity is conserved or variable. For both protocols, our focus is on asymmetric interactions between agents involving directed graphs. Specifically, we define how the dynamics of conservative and non-conservative networks relate to the weighted in-degree Laplacian and the weighted out-degree Laplacian. Our framework allows the addition and subtraction of the considered quantity to and from a set of nodes. This enables the modeling of stubborn agents with time-invariant quantities, and the process of dynamic learning. We highlight several stability and convergence characteristics of our framework, and define the conditions under which asymptotic convergence is guaranteed when the network topology is variable. In addition, we indicate how our framework accommodates external network control and targeted network design. We show how network diffusion can be externally manipulated by applying time-varying input functions at individual nodes. Desirable network structures can also be constructed by adjusting the dominant diffusion modes. To this purpose, we propose a Markov decision process that learns these network adjustments through a reinforcement learning algorithm, suitable for large networks. The presented network control and design schemes enable flow modifications that allow the alteration of the dynamic and stationary behavior of the network in conservative and non-conservative networks.",

    "summary": "The Daya Bay experiment was the first to report simultaneous measurements of reactor antineutrinos at multiple baselines leading to the discovery of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ oscillations over km-baselines. Subsequent data has provided the world's most precise measurement of $\\rm{sin}^22\\theta_{13}$ and the effective mass splitting $\\Delta m_{ee}^2$. The experiment is located in Daya Bay, China where the cluster of six nuclear reactors is among the world's most prolific sources of electron antineutrinos. Multiple antineutrino detectors are deployed in three underground water pools at different distances from the reactor cores to search for deviations in the antineutrino rate and energy spectrum due to neutrino mixing. Instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), the water pools serve as shielding against natural radioactivity from the surrounding rock and provide efficient muon tagging. Arrays of resistive plate chambers over the top of each pool provide additional muon detection. The antineutrino detectors were specifically designed for measurements of the antineutrino flux with minimal systematic uncertainty. Relative detector efficiencies between the near and far detectors are known to better than 0.2%. With the unblinding of the final two detectors' baselines and target masses, a complete description and comparison of the eight antineutrino detectors can now be presented. This paper describes the Daya Bay detector systems, consisting of eight antineutrino detectors in three instrumented water pools in three underground halls, and their operation through the first year of eight detector data-taking.",

    "summary": "Current methods of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of graphene on copper are complicated by multiple processing steps and by high temperatures required in both preparing the copper and inducing subsequent film growth. Here we demonstrate a plasma-enhanced CVD chemistry that enables the entire process to take place in a single step, at reduced temperatures (< 420 C), and in a matter of minutes. Growth on copper foils is found to nucleate from arrays of well-aligned domains, and the ensuing films possess sub-nanometre smoothness, excellent crystalline quality, low strain, few defects and room temperature electrical mobility up to (6.0 +- 1.0) x 10^{4} cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}, better than that of large, single-crystalline graphene derived from thermal CVD growth. These results indicate that elevated temperatures and crystalline substrates are not necessary for synthesizing high-quality graphene.",

Traditionally, the approach for embedded platforms is to either train a small DNN directly, or to train a small DNN that learns the output distribution of a large DNN. In this paper, we utilize a state-of-the-art RNN to transfer knowledge to small DNN. We use the RNN model to generate soft alignments and minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence against the small DNN.

In the following, we optimize rateless codes for unequal error protection (UEP) for multimedia multicasting to a set of heterogeneous users. The proposed designs have the objectives of providing either guaranteed or best-effort quality of service (QoS). A randomly interleaved rateless encoder is proposed whereby users only need to decode symbols up to their own QoS level. The proposed coder is optimized based on measured transmission properties of standardized raptor codes over wireless channels. It is shown that a guaranteed QoS problem formulation can be transformed into a convex optimization problem, yielding a globally optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimized random interleaved UEP rateless coder's performance compares favorably with that of other recently proposed UEP rateless codes.",

    "summary": "The strong Coulomb interactions and the small exciton radii in two-dimensional metal dichalcogenides can result in very fast capture of electrons and holes of excitons by mid-gap defects from Auger processes. In the Auger processes considered here, an exciton is annihilated at a defect site with the capture of the electron (or the hole) by the defect and the hole (or the electron) is scattered to a high energy. In the case of excitons, the probability of finding an electron and a hole near each other is enhanced many folds compared to the case of free uncorrelated electrons and holes. Consequently, the rate of carrier capture by defects from Auger scattering for excitons in metal dichalcogenides can be 100-1000 times larger than for uncorrelated electrons and holes for carrier densities in the $10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ range. We calculate the capture times of electrons and holes by defects and show that the capture times can be in the sub-picosecond to a few picoseconds range. The capture rates exhibit linear as well as quadratic dependence on the exciton density. These fast time scales agree well with the recent experimental observations, and point to the importance of controlling defects in metal dichalcogenides for optoelectronic applications.",

Average lifetimes of thermally distributed excitons depend linearly on the exciton temperature and can be in the few picoseconds range at small temperatures and more than a nanosecond near room temperature. Localized excitons exhibit lifetimes in the same range and the lifetime increases as the localization length decreases. The radiative lifetimes of trions are in the hundreds of picosecond range and increase with the increase in the trion momentum. Average lifetimes of thermally distributed trions increase with the trion temperature as the trions acquire thermal energy and larger momenta.

Plasmon modes in graphene microstructures interact strongly via the depolarization fields. An accurate quantitative description of the coupling between plasmon modes is required for designing and understanding complex plasmonic devices. Drawing inspiration from microphotonics, we present a coupled-mode theory for graphene plasmonics in which the plasmon eigenmodes of a coupled system are expressed in terms of the plasmon eigenmodes of its uncoupled sub-systems. The coupled-mode theory enables accurate computation of the coupling between the plasmon modes and of the resulting dynamics. We compare theory with experiments performed on the plasmon modes in coupled arrays of graphene strips. In experiments, we tune the coupling by changing the spacing between the graphene strips in the array. Our results show that the coupling parameters obtained from the coupled-mode theory and the plasmon frequency changes resulting from this coupling agree very well with experiments. The work presented here provides a framework for designing and understanding coupled graphene plasmonic structures.",

Alignments with equal scores are iteratively rescored with the joint weight matrix of increasing level (nucleotide pairs, triplets and so on) until one single best alignment is eventually found. This method for resolving ambiguity in multiple sequence alignment can be easily implemented by use of the improved scoring matrix.",

    "summary": "Radiative efficiency of highly luminescent bulk InP wafers severely degrades upon heat treatment involved in epitaxial growth of quaternary layers and fabrication of photodiodes on the surface.

On the other hand, it is known that thin epitaxial InP layers, grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), do not exhibit any degradation. These layers, however, are too thin to be useful in scintillators. The capability of hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) process to grow thick bulk-like layers in reasonable time is well known, but the radiative properties of HVPE InP layers are not known. We have studied radiative properties of 21 micron thick InP layers grown by HVPE and found them comparable to those of best luminescent bulk InP virgin wafers. In contrast to the bulk wafers, the radiative efficiency of HVPE layers does not degrade upon heat treatment. This opens up the possibility of implementing free-standing epitaxial InP scintillator structures endowed with surface photodiodes for registration of the scintillation.",

    "summary": "The New York Public Library is participating in the Chronicling America initiative to develop an online searchable database of historically significant newspaper articles. Microfilm copies of the newspapers are scanned and high resolution Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software is run on them. The text from the OCR provides a wealth of data and opinion for researchers and historians. However, categorization of articles provided by the OCR engine is rudimentary and a large number of the articles are labeled editorial without further grouping. Manually sorting articles into fine-grained categories is time consuming if not impossible given the size of the corpus. This paper studies techniques for automatic categorization of newspaper articles so as to enhance search and retrieval on the archive. We explore unsupervised (e.g. KMeans) and semi-supervised (e.g. constrained clustering) learning algorithms to develop article categorization schemes geared towards the needs of end-users. A pilot study was designed to understand whether there was unanimous agreement amongst patrons regarding how articles can be categorized. It was found that the task was very subjective and consequently automated algorithms that could deal with subjective labels were used. While the small scale pilot study was extremely helpful in designing machine learning algorithms, a much larger system needs to be developed to collect annotations from users of the archive. The \"BODHI\" system currently being developed is a step in that direction, allowing users to correct wrongly scanned OCR and providing keywords and tags for newspaper articles used frequently. On successful implementation of the beta version of this system, we hope that it can be integrated with existing software being developed for the Chronicling America project.",

    "summary": "This paper reviews the status of high temperature superconductors for high field magnets for future devices such as a high energy LHC or a muon collider. Some of the primary challenges faced for the implementation of systems are discussed. Two conductor technologies, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$, have emerged as high field conductor options, but their relative advantages and disadvantages for high field magnets are quite different. These are reviewed from an engineering perspective, including coil manufacturing, electromechanical behaviour and quench behaviour. Lastly, the important roles of \"system pull\" upon conductor and magnet technology development, and of interactions between the materials and magnet communities for accelerating development, are discussed.",

    "categories": "cs.CR quant-ph",
    "summary": "Recently, Choi \\emph{et al}. proposed an assumption on Mayers-Lo-Chau (MLC) no-go theorem that the state of the entire quantum system is invariable to both participants before the unveiling phase. This means that the theorem is only applicable to static quantum bit commitment (QBC). This paper find that the assumption is unnecessary and the MLC no-go theorem can be applied to not only static QBC, but also non-static one. A non-static QBC protocol proposed by Choi \\emph{et al.} is briefly reviewed and analyzed to work as a supporting example. In addition, a novel way to prove the impossibility of the two kinds of QBC is given.",

    "summary": "Operation of semiconductor scintillators requires optically-tight integration of the photoreceiver system on the surface of the scintillator slab. We have implemented an efficient and fast quaternary InGaAsP pin photodiode, epitaxially grown upon the surface of an InP scintillator wafer and sensitive to InP luminescence. The diode is characterized by an extremely low room-temperature dark current, about 1 nA/cm2 at the reverse bias of 2 V. The low leakage makes possible a sensitive readout circuitry even though the diode has a large area (1 mm/times1 mm) and therefore large capacitance (50 pF). Results of electrical, optical and radiation testing of the diodes are presented. Detection of individual \\alpha-particles and \\gamma-photons is demonstrated.",

We prove the existence of a small-height basis for $Z$ over $D$, such that $F(X,X)$ vanishes at each of the basis vectors. This constitutes a non-commutative analogue of a theorem of Vaaler, and presents an extension of the classical theorem of Cassels on small zeros of rational quadratic forms to the context of quaternion algebras.",

    "summary": "Secret sharing is a procedure for sharing a secret among a number of participants such that only the qualified subsets of participants have the ability to reconstruct the secret. Even in the presence of eavesdropping, secret sharing can be achieved when all the members are quantum. So what happens if not all the members are quantum? In this paper we propose two semi-quantum secret sharing protocols using maximally entangled GHZ-type states in which quantum Alice shares a secret with two classical parties, Bob and Charlie, in a way that both parties are sufficient to obtain the secret, but one of them cannot. The presented protocols are also showed to be secure against eavesdropping.",

    "summary": "Urn models have been widely studied and applied in both scientific and social science disciplines. In clinical studies, the adoption of urn models in treatment allocation schemes has been proved to be beneficial to both researchers, by providing more efficient clinical trials, and patients, by increasing the likelihood of receiving the better treatment. In this paper, we propose a new and general class of immigrated urn (IMU) models that incorporates the immigration mechanism into the urn process. Theoretical properties are developed and the advantages of the IMU models are discussed. In general, the IMU models have smaller variabilities than the classical urn models, yielding more powerful statistical inferences in applications. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the wide applicability of the IMU models. The proposed IMU framework, including many popular classical urn models, not only offers a unify perspective for us to comprehend the urn process, but also enables us to generate several novel urn models with desirable properties.",

    "summary": "In a conventional quantum (k,n) threshold scheme, a trusted party shares a secret quantum state with n participants such that any k of those participants can cooperate to recover the original secret, while fewer than k participants obtain no information about the secret. In this paper we show how to construct a quantum (k,n) threshold scheme without the assistance of a trusted party, who generates and distributes shares among the participants. Instead, each participant chooses his private state and contributes the same to the determination of the final secret quantum state.",

The local entanglement between the middle two sites and the rest of the system, and the block entanglement between the left and right portions of the system, are calculated using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We find that the entanglement shows interesting scaling and singular behavior around the phase transition line.",

    "summary": "We quantify the total, quantum, and classical correlations with entropic measures, and quantitatively compare these correlations in a quantum system, as exemplified by a Heisenberg dimer which is subjected to the change of environmental parameters: temperature and nonuniform external field. Our results show that the quantum correlation may exceed the classical correlation at some nonzero temperatures, though the former is rather fragile than the later under thermal fluctuation. The effect of the external field to the classical correlation is quite different from the quantum correlation.",

    "summary": "Response-adaptive designs have been extensively studied and used in clinical trials. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive study of response-adaptive designs that include covariates, despite their importance in clinical experiments. Because the allocation scheme and the estimation of parameters are affected by both the responses and the covariates, covariate-adjusted response-adaptive (CARA) designs are very complex to formulate. In this paper, we overcome the technical hurdles and lay out a framework for general CARA designs for the allocation of subjects to $K (\\geq 2)$ treatments. The asymptotic properties are studied under certain widely satisfied conditions. The proposed CARA designs can be applied to generalized linear models. Two important special cases, the linear model and the logistic regression model, are considered in detail.",

    "summary": "We show that the decay of sinusoidal ripples on crystal surfaces, where mass transport is limited by the attachment and detachment of atoms at the step-edges, is remarkably different from the decay behavior that has been reported until now. Unlike the decreasing or at most constant rate of amplitude decay of sinusoidal profiles observed in earlier work, we find that the decay rate increases with decreasing amplitude in this kinetic regime. The rate of shape invariant amplitude relaxation is shown to be inversely proportional to both the square of the wavelength and the current amplitude. We have also carried out numerical simulations of the relaxation of realistic sputter ripples.",
